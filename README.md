## Files List

1.	**Research Proposal Poster (PDF)**: This is a research proposal with preliminary findings on Chinese antiquities in US museums. It includes a metadata survey from 56 museum databases, an initial social network analysis of collectors based on historical books, and provenance visualization using a JSON file from the Cleveland Museum of Art. The R and Python code for the plots in the poster are attached.

2.	**Google Map List**: Includes the 56 museums involved in the study. Save it to your own Google account. Note: You may need to scroll to the end of the list to ensure all museums load. https://maps.app.goo.gl/e5Gx4PqYxifUp3Ls9

3.	**Google Spreadsheet**: Provides detailed information on Chinese arts and antiquities in 56 US museums, including names of the museums, collection and on-view numbers, geographic coordinates, and metadata from online collections. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HzemHEQdIYgomtxlhEZtfs3DjjU9Bj-rh9_T5Qoe0rQ/edit?usp=sharing

4.	**Cypher Notebook**: Contains code that you can implement in an IDE platform like VSCode, or you can copy and paste this code into Neo4j to create a graph database representing the social network of Chinese antiquities dealers, collectors, and institutions. This project is ongoing.

5.	**Chinese Paintings Cataloging Policy and Work Records**: This file provides a metadata schema for cataloging ancient Chinese paintings. Note: This was the final assignment for the IST616 Information Resources: Organization and Access course and was developed as a cataloging policy for a hypothetical virtual project.
